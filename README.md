# Hello everyone! I'm Diego - aka YeyoM
My name is Diego and I’m a Compruter Science student focused on web development. I started coding back in 2019 when I was in high school. I’m currently in college.

By now, I’m looking for my first Internship or my first approach with the IT work field. My main tech core is based mostly in JavaScript and all around with web development and I’m passionate about building great and excellent digital products that live on the internet.

Apart from coding, you will normally find me playing basketball or maybe playing guitar, who knows?
