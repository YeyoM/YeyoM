## Hello everyone! I'm Yeyo :octocat:

I'm Diego Moreno, a computer science student at Universidad Aut√≥noma de Aguascalientes, Mex and a Site Reliability Engineer Intern at Petco. I have a strong passion for software engineering and all the exciting aspects that come with it. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a keen interest in SRE and DevOps practices, ensuring websites are reliable and accessible for all users.

In addition to my technical skills, I value collaboration and effective communication within development teams. I believe in the power of teamwork and appreciate the diverse perspectives that each team member brings to the table. Some cool facts about me:
